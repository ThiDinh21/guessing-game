# A simple CLI guessing game
Tutorial project made in Rust


## Download and run
### Download Rust
#### On Mac/Linux
Open a terminal and enter the following command:

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

If the install is successful, the following line will appear:

`Rust is installed now. Great!`


#### On Windows
On Windows, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions for installing Rust. 
At some point in the installation, you’ll receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later. 
The easiest way to acquire the build tools is to install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019. 
When asked which workloads to install make sure "C++ build tools" is selected and that the Windows 10 SDK and the English language pack components are included.
